/**
 * Host-only driver for every bot in the room - one real browser (the
 * host's) has to actually make bots' moves, same single-writer reasoning
 * as useHostAfkWatchdog. `game` is GameState | undefined - GameBoard
 * calls this before its own `if (!game) return null` guard, same as
 * useHostAfkWatchdog/useSoundEvents already do.
 *
 * Re-triggers (and detects a stuck no-op, see below) off
 * gameProgressSignature - a full snapshot of `game` - rather than
 * game.log.length. An earlier version used log.length, which broke
 * silently once a game passed ~20 logged events: logEvent caps the log
 * there, so its length stops changing for the rest of the match even
 * though real actions keep happening, and bots would just stop taking
 * their next action the moment that happened (most visibly, freezing
 * forever on a card draw, since nothing else can happen on that decision
 * until it resolves).
 *
 * Stuck-action safety net: tracks the (botId, decision fingerprint,
 * state signature) of the last attempt. If the next tick would repeat
 * the exact same attempt against byte-identical state, the previous
 * write must have no-op'd (a mismatched guard versus game/engine.ts) -
 * runBotStep is then told to force its guaranteed-effective fallback
 * instead, so a hand-mirrored guard doesn't need to be flawless to avoid
 * ever freezing the game.
