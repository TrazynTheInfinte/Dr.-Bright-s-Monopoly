 * even finished moving, since every viewer just receives the whole
 * finished result in one snapshot.
 *
 * This hook returns a "staged" GameState for rendering: when the mover's
 * position changes by a normal move's worth of tiles, it holds every
 * OTHER field at its previous values while stepping the mover's
 * position through each intermediate tile, only adopting the full new
 * state (revealing the card prompt, updated Credits, log entries,
 * everything at once) once the walk finishes. A teleport-sized jump (or
 * no movement at all - a Dev Panel edit, etc.) adopts the new state
 * immediately, no delay.
